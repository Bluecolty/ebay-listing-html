        <h1>About This Listing</h1>
            <p>This listing is for aftermarket AmpSentrix replacement iPhone batteries for the iPhone 4 through the 5s, including the iPhone SE (2016), hence the distinguishing name "beveled". These batteries will ship in a retail package with the pull tabs preinstalled. Individual voltage levels and mAh for the iPhone 4-5s/SE 2016 batteries are listed below. Optional repair tools can be ordered alongside the purchase of a battery.</p>
        
        <h1>About AmpSentrix iPhone Batteries</h1>
            <p>What makes AmpSentrix batteries "professional"? AmpSentrix batteries are used all across North American cellphone repair shops due to their high quality and reliability. They are one of a few iPhone replacement battery manufactuerers based in the US and distributed by MobileSentrix (based in Virginia).</p>
                
            <p>AmpSentrix batteries are only available through MobileSentrix.com, and since MobileSentrix only caters to larger volume independent repair technicians, these professional quality batteries aren't available to the average consumer directly. Since I have an active buisness account through MobileSentrix, I'm able to purchase them in bulk and resell them on eBay.</p>
        
        <h1>AmpSentrix iPhone Batteries Are Garaunteed (by the manufacturer) to;</h1>
            <li>Always report the battery health</li>
            <li>Be brand new with 0 charge cycles and at 100% health</li>
            <li>Ensure consistent and clean power delivery for optimal performance (no random shutdowns!)</li>
            
            <p><strong>Due to some of these devices running older iOS versions below iOS 13, official Apple software battery health is not available. Please use a third party software like 3uTools to measure battery health.</strong></p>
        
        <h1>These Aren't Your Standard eBay Battery!</h1>
            <p>Speaking from personal expierences, I've had terrible luck with generic eBay batteries. Some have swelled, some don't report the battery health, some cause random shutdowns, and some don't even work at all. I eventually stopped buying batteries on eBay completely after many bad experiences.</p>
        
            <p>I've used over 40 of these AmpSentrix batteries in various iPhone repairs and restorations, and have never had an issue. What can I say, they've been great. And no, this is not a sponsored listing by AmpSentrix. I'm just trying to change the stigma around cheap eBay batteries. The well known YouTuber PhoneRepairGuru uses this brand of batteries in his iPhone repair videos. He has over 1,000,000 subscribers, so if he hasn't found a better battery brand, we all probably won't either.</p>
        
        <h1>Basic Repair Tools</h1>
            <p>To order the basic set of tools, simply select the "tools" option and add it to your cart along with your battery of choice. The basic set of tools will be shipped in the same package as your battery. The set of tools includes the essential screw bits and pry tools to perform a battery replacement on the iPhone 6 through the 7 Plus. I reccomend buying a better set of tools seperately, but these will get the job done in a pinch.</p>
        
        <h1>Warranty and Return Information</h1>
            <p>As an eBay seller I can uphold the first 30 days of the 1 year manufacturer warranty. If there is an issue with a replacement battery within the first 30 days, the battery must be returned for a full refund. No partial refunds will be given because I need the battery back, so I can open a warranty claim with MobileSentrix.</p>
